Twitter client for posting long tweets, written in self-editing Ruby

Usage: cuttweet.rb [options] [tweet ID] [tweet]

When a tweet ID is provided, cuttweet answers this tweet. You can find the
tweet ID in the URL of a tweet; for example, 76322558840020992 is the tweet ID
for https://twitter.com/#!/Phlogistique/status/76322558840020992

If you don't write the tweet on command line, cuttweet will invoke vim for
editing the tweet.

Because it is self-editing code, it has to be installed as writeable by the
user. If you have several accounts, install several instances, named after each
one of your accounts.

Options:
     --help          Displays help
  -a --get-new-auth  Re-authentify and get a new token and secret for Twitter
